# Creation-Of-A-Classification-Model-To-Predict-Salary

our data is extracted from the 1994 censure bureau database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker(Data mining and Visualization, Silicon Graphics).

Then we apply EDA on our database and after that we create a classification model to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year or not.
